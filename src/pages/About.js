					<p>
						Why Diool?
					</p>
					<p>
						It starts with a conviction that technology can help find and scale solutions for our communities need...
					</p>
					<p>
						It fuels our drive to build things that make our lives simpler.
					</p>
					<p>
						We need only three weapons : expertise, creativity and determination.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our age is a fantastic one, with mobile connectivity, and unbridled innovation... 
					</p>
					<p>
						It's become easy to connect with almost anyone anywhere.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mobile payments are such an innovation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Itâ€™s become easy to exchange money with almost anyone anywhere. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Our focus is on small merchants, a cornerstone of retail ecosystems
					</p>
					<p class="clr_">Our mission is to improve retail finance for those merchants.</p>
					<p>	
						Their goals, their needs are shaped by cultural habits, influenced by enabling technologies. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For the engineer, the designer, the builder in us, it's a powerful stage.
						One where we can imagine sleeker services and better user experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						To do that, three simple rules guide us:
					</p>
					<p class="clt_0">
						- observe people<br/>
						- learn their needs<br />
						- design better solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Without restraint, we strive to enrich or improve.
					</p>
					<p class="clr_">We have only one goal : make their transactions simpler</p>
